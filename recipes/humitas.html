<h2> Description </h2>
<p> A "humita salteña" is a traditional dish from the region of Salta in northern Argentina.
     It is a type of tamale made from a mixture of fresh corn, cheese, and spices, wrapped 
     in corn husks and then cooked.</p>

<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul>
    <li> 18 ears of corn </li>
    <li>1/2 kg of onion</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
    <li>Green onions to taste</li>
    <li>Paprika</li>
    <li>Oil and salt to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 kg of country-style cheese or processed cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2> Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>
    Fry the onion, bell peppers, and green onions in oil with
    a pinch of salt and paprika for about 10 minutes.</p>

    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>
    Process the corn kernels either in a blender or using
    a grater, and pour them into the previous mixture in the same pot.</p>
    
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>
        Add a level tablespoon of either fine or coarse salt.
        Stir until the mixture becomes paste-like, not liquid.</p>

    <li>Step 4</li>
    <p>
        Turn off the heat and add the cheese in cubes.</p>

    <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>
            Proceed to assemble the humitas once the mixture has cooled.</p>

    <li>Step 6</li>
         <p>
            Lastly, once the humitas are assembled, place them all together
             in an orderly manner in a pot and pour water until it just barely
              covers them, not too much. Boil for approximately 20 to 30 minutes,
               then they are ready to be taken out and served.</p>
